	abstract = "A cryptographic proof-of-custody is a zero-knowledge proof of simultaneous possession of a given data set and a private key. We will introduce proof-of-custody by explaining its application in incentivized file-sharing, and then we will formalize the conditions that it must satisfy. We then present a solution and provide calculations of its computational and bandwidth efficiency. Additionally, we will present 'initially promising solutions' and attack vectors against them, in the appendix.",

	abstract = "In this thesis, the problem of estimating trust in distributed systems is considered. Distributed systems can be virtual or real-world systems in which multiple agents interact. One of the biggest problems in distributed systems is that they only function well if everyone contributes some resources. If agents do not participate, or try to pretend they participate, but in fact are slacking off, then the system might not achieve its desired purpose. This work presents
	two methods to estimate how well agents contribute to the network, while preventing cheating. Firstly, the {N}et{F}low algorithm, which uses max-flow computations to bound the profit of cheating by Sybil attacks. Secondly, the {T}emporal {P}age{R}ank algorithm, which uses information about the ordering of the interactions to provide a robust mechanism to determine reputation. Theoretical guarantees about several aspects of these algorithms are provided. Furthermore, these	mechanisms are tested on data from a real-world distributed system: {T}ribler, an anonymous	peer-to-peer downloading system. Finally, taking both the theoretical and practical results, the	broader implications of these mechanisms and future possibilities are explored.",
