	abstract = "A cryptographic proof-of-custody is a zero-knowledge proof of simultaneous possession of a given data set and a private key. We will introduce proof-of-custody by explaining its application in incentivized file-sharing, and then we will formalize the conditions that it must satisfy. We then present a solution and provide calculations of its computational and bandwidth efficiency. Additionally, we will present 'initially promising solutions' and attack vectors against them, in the appendix.",
