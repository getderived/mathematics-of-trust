\chapter{Preface}
This book is a continuous work in progress while the Delft University of Technology Blockchain researches cooperation in distributed systems. 
Its aim is to support members of the lab by
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	providing a convenient introduction to (the mathematics of) the subject,
	\item
	supplying an overview of previous work by both the lab and others,
	\item
	making explicit the gap between mathematical theory and real-world deployable systems.
\end{itemize}
In this way, we hope the lab can work in the most structured way towards its long-term goal of realizing a universal mechanism to create trust.
