\section{Intuition}
It is quite easy to describe intuitively what we want the reputation function $r$ to achieve. 
It should reward good behavior, 
such as contributing to those who contribute, 
and punish behavior that threatens the health of the system, 
such as free riding. 
The difficulty is of course how to formalize the different behaviors.

\section{Requirements for the reputation function}\label{section:requirements_reputation}
We will first describe several properties which the reputation function should at least respect if we want to achieve $\lim_{|H| \to \infty} L_M(H) < \infty$.

\subsection{Sybil resistance}\index{Sybil attack}
Because all agents create and maintain their own chain, as well as are allowed to join the market freely, creating a new chain (and as such, a new identity) is cheap.\footnote{For a potential solution, see section \ref{sssection:chain_creation_cost}}

\section{Examples of reputation functions}\label{section:examples_reputation_functions}
% TODO: Show how a simple maximize \sigma fails finite leakage properties

\section{Deciding on fairness}
% TODO: What is the behavior we want to be rewarded? If there are many possible reputation functions to make such a system work, what do we want it to achieve?
