\section{Intuition}
It is quite easy to describe intuitively what we want the reputation function $r$ to achieve. It should reward good behavior, such as contributing to those who contribute, and punish behavior that threatens the health of the system, such as free riding. The difficulty is of course how to formalize the different behaviors.

\section{Deciding on fairness}
% TODO: What is the behavior we want to be rewarded? If there are many possible reputation functions to make such a system work, what do we want it to achieve?
