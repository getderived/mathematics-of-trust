\chapter{Further research}
We identify unanswered questions several area's of future research. 
This chapter provides an overview of these questions and attempts to structure them.

\section{Identity and secrets}
\subsection{Proof of transmission}
In section \ref{sssection:proof_of_transmission} it was mentioned that a proof of transmission over a \emph{passive} channel is impossible. 
A passive channel is one in which ``does not modify or sign the data it transmits'' \cite{kravchenko}. 
It may however be possible to realize such a proof using other nodes in the network.

\section{Sybil prevention}
\subsection{Computational feasibility of NetFlow}
While NetFlow gives strong guarantees for sybil resistance, the computational complexity of the algorithm is too great \cite{otte2016sybil}. NetFlow could, for example,
\begin{itemize}
	\item be approximated, while its sybil defense mechanism deteriorates only an acceptable amount, or
	\item be extended with the exchange of results of computations.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Expand upon this

\subsection{PageRank}
While PageRank is relatively cheap to approximate precisely, it is unclear what guarantees it provides, if any. Among the open questions about PageRank are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the different metrics we can calculate the PageRank score on, and what do they tell us about the participants?
	\item Does the PageRank score provide any (probabilistic) guarantees?
	\item Should temporal aspects be included in this computation? How?
	\item How could different PageRank scores, computed on different network metrics, complement each other?
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Expand upon this

\subsection{About time}
% TODO: How to reduce the importance of historic events, if at all

\section{Advanced concepts}
\subsection{Smart contracts}
% TODO: Whether fourth generation blockchains can offer a runtime environment
