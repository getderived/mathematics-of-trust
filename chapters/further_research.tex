\chapter{Open problems}
We identify unanswered questions several area's of future research. 
This chapter provides an overview of these questions and attempts to structure them.

\section{Basic building blocks}
\subsection{Proof of transmission}
In section \ref{sssection:proof_of_transmission} it was mentioned that a proof of transmission over a \emph{passive} channel is impossible. 
A passive channel is one in which ``does not modify or sign the data it transmits'' \cite{kravchenko}. 
It may however be possible to realize such a proof using other nodes in the network.

\section{Advanced concepts}
\subsection{Smart contracts}
