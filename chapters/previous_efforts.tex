\chapter{Previous Systems}
The systems mentioned in this chapter were notable milestones in the search for free-rider prevention mechanisms. They are not implemented in Tribler.

\section{EigenTrust (2004)}
EigenTrust calculates trust in a peer-to-peer network using a PageRank-like vector based on rankings given by nodes. See \cite{kamvar2003eigentrust}.

\section{BarterCast (2009)}
BarterCast uses MaxFlow calculations in two directions to judge a potential peer as either a free-rider or contributer. See \cite{meulpolder2009bartercast}.
